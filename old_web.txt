          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> I am a Junior studying Software Engineering at the Rochester Institute
            of Technology. I enjoy boxing, hitting the gym, and hanging out on my computer.
            My favorite language so far is Java and the work I am most proud of
            is creating subsystem designs that utilized software design frameworks like
            Factory, Decorator, and Strategy. I am currently looking for a  2020-21 co-op.

            <h5>Secret Santa</h5>
            <p><i>Secret Santa is an application I developed in Java and is run through
            the comand line. The user can enter and removes names into a list and then can generate mappings of
            a person to a single name. I created this application to play around with Java and the command
            line and to experiment a little with the language</i></p>
            <h5>Notes Page</h5>
            <p><i>This application was developed in React and was a project that I wanted to do so I could get
            familiar with using React. I taught myself React and this project allowed me to reinforce some of the coding concepts.
            The application acts as a note taker in that you can add and remove custom made notes to and from a list of other
            notes that have been added.</i></p>
            <h5>Gym Homie</h5>
            <p><i>
              I created this application using React Native with expo. This was my first project using React Native and I learned a lot About
              JavaScript, JSX, flex-boxing, and general mobile app knowledge such as navigation. Currently, the app is stores workout information
              that includes a day tracker and exercise input fields. The app is still being worked on, and I plan to add more features like program
              switching and a boxing section!

            <h2>BrickHack 6</h2>
            <p>I participated in the 6th hackathon at my college: BrickHack. I was on a team of four people and the theme we went for was
              social good. We decided to use python and the flask framework to build a web app that also ran a MongoDB database. Our web app allowed a user to
              sign in and create a profile. From there, they could make posts asking for someone to go to the gym. Furthermore, the user could look at and post gym tips, and
              view workouts for a particular body part like the chest. Our goal with this app was to connect the RIT fitness community as well as promote
              a healthy and active lifesyle to our college community. The code will be located on my github page!
