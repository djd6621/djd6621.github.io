            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a sophmore studying Software Engineering at the Rochester Institute
              of Technology. I enjoy boxing, hitting the gym, and hanging out on my computer.
              My favorite language so far is Java and the work I am most proud of
              is the code I created for a WebCheckers webapp in one of my software class.
              I am currently looking for a summer/fall/both 2020 internship.
            </p>

                  <h5>Secret Santa</h5>
                  <p><i>Secret Santa is an application I developed in Java and is run through
                  the comand line. The user can enter and removes names into a list and then can generate mappings of
                  a person to a single name. I created this application to play around with Java and the command
                  line and to experiment a little with the language</i></p>
                  <h5>Notes Page</h5>
                  <p><i>This application was developed in React and was a project that I wanted to do so I could get
                  familiar with using React. I taught myself React and this project allowed me to reinforce some of the coding concepts.
                  The application acts as a note taker in that you can add and remove custom made notes to and from a list of other
                  notes that have been added.</i></p>
